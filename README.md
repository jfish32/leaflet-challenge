# leaflet-challenge

In this challenge we used d3 to pull quake data in for mapping.  I went with the last 30 days all quakes, I did not do part 2 of the assignment.

I have two map views, street and topo in the top right and you can also toggle the quakes on the map or not.  

I was having an issue getting the legend to appear on the bottom right so I did ask chatgpt why it was not appearing and I had to go in to the css file and add styling to it.  I used 50,000 to multiply the magnitude by to make the circles more visible, this does result in a crowded map, however it is better to visualize globabally than if I chose a smaller number.
